      Traditional data warehouses are failing to meet the increased scale and
      analytics demands that growing businesses are experiencing. The current
      data warehouse system is powerful, scalable, and affordableâ€”enabling
      organizations to share petabytes of data across thousands of users with
      the security, governance, and availability that large enterprises demand.
      A data warehousing is defined as a technique to collect and manage data
      from varied sources to provide meaningful business insights. It is a
      mixture of technologies and components that helps the strategic use of
      data.
      <br />
      The exponential growth of information from diverse sources in various
      formats and quality presents a problem in the management of information
      and its utilization, and data warehousing itself.
