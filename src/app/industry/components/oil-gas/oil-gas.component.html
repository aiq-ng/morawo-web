      Among the challenges facing the oil and gas industry today, big data is a
      source of optimism. Indeed, there are many challenges for the oil and gas
      industry, caught between rising production costs and fluctuating prices.

      revisit the existing models, relying more and more on the power of big
      data. In other words, the challenges facing the sector today are an
      opportunity for operations to rethink the way they work.<br /><br />

      the industrial ecosystem is always more difficult. Production costs are on
      the rise, and the only way to increase margins is to surrender to the
      power of Big Data.
