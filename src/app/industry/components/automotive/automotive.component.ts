      Thanks to data processing, companies can reach the most interesting conclusions. On the one hand, the internal processing allows obtaining information about the company itself. On the other hand, external processing allows access to data about the target audience, among others, to be able to define the behavior or motivations of the user of a certain territory.`,

On the one hand, the data processing of the company's clients is carried out, and on the other, comments from social networks and the internet can be collected.
      Thus, once both slopes have been crossed, the automobile company is able to adapt its production based on these data-based variables. Despite this, it is necessary to order the information correctly and have a professional with analytical capacity who knows how to interpret the data to turn it into knowledge, such as knowing which finishes would be sold the most, which accessories users demand the most or what type of vehicle would prefer each segment.`,
