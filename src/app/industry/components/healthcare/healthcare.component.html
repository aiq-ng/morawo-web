      With the help of artificial intelligences and data analytics, data can be
      analyzed to achieve a significant awareness that are essential for
      efficient healthcare services.<br />
      <br />

      Data science in the healthcare sector can help improve diagnostics and
      treatment, as well as the management of physical and human resources.<br />
      <br />
      The digital transformation that a large number of organizations from all
      productive sectors go through and the enormous amount of data (structured,
      unstructured, video and images) generated by it in multiple channels
      (physical, online, mobile and social) results in what we know as Big Data,
      which in turn has triggered the popularity of data analyics around the
      world. <br />

      Some benefits that data analytics can bring to healthcare:
    </h4>
    <p class="font-normal my-2 text-sm">
      • Help in the generation of better diagnoses.<br />
      • Facilitate more personalized medical treatment.<br />
      • Improve hospital management.<br />
      • Prevent readmissions of patients.<br />

    </h4>
    <p class="font-normal text-sm my-1">
      The applications of Big Data in medicine and in the health sector in
      general, have a place in practically all areas: genomics, epidemiology,
      clinical trials, clinical operations, citizen collaboration, telecare, and
      administrative management. In all these areas, the future of the health
      and health systems and models involves collecting, storing, screening,
      analyzing and consulting the avalanche of data that technological advances
      are generating in a structured, secure and duly anonymized way. The data
      in the health sector on which to apply Big Data analytical techniques are
      very varied (personal, clinical, administrative data, data from social
      media). The information extracted from all this data has the potential to
      achieve a more effective medicine: a personalized, participatory,
      preventive, predictive and population-based medicine. <br /><br />
      Being able to identify and anticipate the needs of patients, health
      centers or clinical laboratories is the result of applying Big Data
      technology in healthcare. Analyzing the impact of the social and the study
      of historical data allows defining specific preventive policies.

      The rise of the internet and the possibilities it offers patients,
      doctors, family members and other stakeholders to create and participate
      in eHealth online communities is associated with the concepts of
      e-patient, online influence and the ability to jointly develop proposals
      based on Big Data techniques of free text analysis, sentiment analysis and
      automatic normalization and coding of medical data to achieve: 
    </p>
    <p class="font-normal text-sm my-1">
      • Test with better clinical results. <br />
      • Design of new treatments. <br />
      • Reduction of medical errors. <br />
      • More effective prevention measures. <br />
      • Personalized healthcare. <br />
    </p>
    <p class="font-normal text-sm my-2">
      Participatory medicine makes citizens more responsible for their own
      health. With the information generated by the data analysis, the healthy
      individual decides about their health and the patient decides about their
      disease. With this, a greater involvement of all those affected is
      achieved, which facilitates, among other things, a better diagnosis and
      greater adherence to treatments.
